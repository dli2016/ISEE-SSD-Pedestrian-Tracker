# ISEE-SSD-Pedestrian-Tracker
Pedestrian tracking using ssd to do pedestrian detection.

Thanks Yuantao Xie who provides the code to call ssd[1] model (I don't ask the author if I can open it, so we only privide a library here).
While the author of ssd has shown us a example to call the ssd model to do object detection (please refer to: https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/blob/ssd/examples/ssd/ssd_detect.cpp).
