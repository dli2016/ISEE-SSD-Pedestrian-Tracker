# ISEE-SSD-Pedestrian-Tracker
Pedestrian tracking using ssd to do pedestrian detection.

Thanks Yuantao Xie who provides the code to call ssd[1] model (I don't ask Yantao if I can open it, so we only privide a library here).
While the author of ssd has shown us a example to call the ssd model to do object detection (please refer to: https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/blob/ssd/examples/ssd/ssd_detect.cpp).

We only open the jni code here; and the source code on tracking is comming soon...( Now we only provide a library as well).

Any other questions, please feel free to email to: da.li@cripac.ia.ac.cn / dli1988@126.com
